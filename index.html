      <p>
        There are seven species of sea turtles that inhabit the Earth’s oceans:
        loggerhead, leatherback, green turtle, hawksbill, Kemp’s ridley, olive
        ridley and flatback. Except for the flatback, all species occur in North
        American waters and are listed as threatened or endangered under the
        Endangered Species Act. Air-breathing reptiles that have been around for
        110 million years, sea turtles spend different parts of their long lives
        in different parts of the world. What they all have in common is that
        they rely on beaches for nesting. When they’re not nesting, sea turtles
        spend most of their lives in the ocean; much of their journey around the
        globe remains a mystery to researchers. The southeastern United States
        provides globally significant habitat for sea turtles. In fact, Florida
        beaches host 90% of sea turtle nesting in the continental U.S. and the
        largest rookery of loggerhead nesting in the world.
